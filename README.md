Breast cancer is one of the second foremost causes of cancer death in women. Despite the fact that cancer is needless and curable in primary stages, a massive number of patients are diagnosed with cancer very late. Conventional methods of detecting and diagnosing cancer mainly depend on expert physicians, with the assistance of medical imaging, to detect certain symptoms that usually appear in the later phases of cancer.

In 2012, it characterized about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women. Breast cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to raise out of control. These cells generally form a tumor that can frequently be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. The tumor is malignant if the cells can breed into (invade) surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body.
